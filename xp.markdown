### Development Director

As Development Director at Aptean, I fulfilled a number of roles at different times all the way from product design and development to line management, project planning and architecture.

Broadly, my responsibilities fall into one of the following categories:

Line management for developers, tracking and reporting progress against roadmaps, removing blockers and ensuring releases were delivered on time and with quality.

**Architecture and Technology**

Consultancy for various teams on architectural questions including BI, integration,
compliance, technical debt, application security scanning, virtualization etc.

### Technical Lead
*CDC Software 2007-2012*

At CDC Software, I was senior developer and technical lead for a number of products. CDC was a US based company with offices in various countries including India and China and I was lucky to get the opportunity to travel and to learn how distributed development can work effectively.

As well as leading development and implementing a number of new technologies (such as `Spring, Hibernate, JQuery, Selenium and Mockito`) I was also instrumental in bringing on an offshore development team of around 12 people in China and in successfully completing the acquisition and integration of 2 new products (one based in the US and another in Canada).

As well as building expertise in a number of new technologies, I developed a good understanding of agile methogologies and particuarly how to develop and adapt processes that work when developers are not necessarily colocated.

### Software Developer
*MVI Technology 1997-2007*

At MVI, I worked first in technical support and then as a developer, contributing to MVI's CMMS solutions and subsequently creating and developing a new MES system. This was a great place to learn about building and maintaining software systems as well as understanding customer requirements and business drivers.

As a developer, I learnt to write code in Powerbuilder using SQL Server and Oracle moving on to Java and web technologies to build out the new MES system.

Some of the technologies used at MVI: `Java, JSPs, Servlets, Struts, Web (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), SQL Server, Oracle, Tomcat, XML, XSL, Powerbuilder, SQL, Oracle, SQL Server`
