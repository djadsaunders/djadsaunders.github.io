{:.details}
As well as leading development and implementing a number of new technologies (such as `Spring, Hibernate, JQuery, Selenium and Mockito`) I was also instrumental in bringing on an offshore development team of around 12 people in China and in successfully completing the acquisition and integration of 2 new products (one based in the US and another in Canada).

{:.details}
As well as building expertise in a number of new technologies, I developed a good understanding of agile methogologies and particuarly how to develop and adapt processes that work when developers are not necessarily colocated.
