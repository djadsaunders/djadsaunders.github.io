### Development Director
*Aptean/Avolin 2012-2019*

{:.details}
As Development Director at Aptean, I fulfilled a number of roles at different times all the way from product design and development to line management, project planning and architecture. Aptean was a very agile environment and I learnt a lot about how to be adapatable, get up to speed with new concepts quickly and how to manage and lead both downwards and upwards. I learnt a tremendous amount about enterprise software development at Aptean and I really enjoyed my time there.
