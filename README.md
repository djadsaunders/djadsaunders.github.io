# My Website!

This website was built using `Jekyll`, `Bootstrap` and is hosted using `Github Pages`.

Jekykll is a static website framework.

You can create your site using HTML, Markdown and the Liquid template language and Jekyll will compile into a format which can be deployed on a webserver.

Github Pages provides a service by which you can deploy your Jekyll based website and have it available publically.

CSS styling has been mostly implemented using SASS which Jekyll processes as part of building the site.
