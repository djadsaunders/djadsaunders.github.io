title: Management and Leadership
permalink: /management/

Early in my career I took a leadership role; initially Technical Lead for a number of products then on to Delivery Management and Line Management in a range of contexts.

I am equally comfortable pitching in with a sprint to help the team complete their goals as I am mentoring staff, performing appraisals and contributing to business goals and strategy.

I have extensive experience leading teams both locally and remote and in a variety of settings and cultures and I have a strong desire to help teams do the best they can and to continually improve.

I believe a good leader:

* Leads by example
* Gets their hands dirty
* Is *present* i.e. is physically available as often as possible
* Develops others
* Is accountable
* Is consistent
* Is passionate
