I am PSM certified and I am very familiar with coaching teams on Scrum and designing and rolling out SDLC processes and practices.

I am a firm believer in pragmatism and implementing a methodology that *works*. This means that one size cannot fit all; what works in one context may not work in another. It means *being* agile, not just *doing* agile and having an understanding of the purpose behind principles such as 'team empowerment', 'CI/CD' and 'breaking often and early' and implementing them in a way that works in context rather than treating agile as a religion.

As well as a strong understanding of Scrum, I have a lot of experience rolling out agile processes and coaching teams. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to train and develop teams in India and to design methodologies that work in distributed environments.
