# Product Design and Coding

I started my career as a developer and I have many years experience designing and coding software applications.

I've had the chance to work with a broad range of technologies but I've been able to go deeper with Java/web based applications (`Spring, Hibernate, Tomcat, HTML, CSS, Javascript`) and BI solutions (`Data Warehousing, SSAS, SSIS, PowerBI, Qlik`).

Through various management roles, I have always maintained that a good leader should lead by example and I have sought to remain as hands-on as possible.

I feel fortunate that I've had the freedom to create many systems from the ground up and I'm particularly proud to see applications that I built still in use today and commercially successful.

Acknowledging of course, that work doesn't always allow you to learn and use every technology that you may wish to, I have some [projects and pieces of code](/projects) hosted on Github. These are mostly experiments, demos and Kitchen Sink type systems which can be useful as a sandbox and often a reminder of how to implement a particular technology.
